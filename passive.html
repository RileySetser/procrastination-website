                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Passive procrastination is the phenomenon of putting important tasks aside in favor of doing nothing of value. This is what most people conceive procrastination is, and is the most prominent type of procrastination.</p>
                
                <h3>Effects on Mental Health</h3>
                <p>When it comes to procrastination and mental health, some studies suggest that people who procrastinate often experience poorer mental health, as well as increased stress, and according to my data, this is mostly true. When I passively procrastinate, I often feel very unmotivated to get anything done, and want to take a nap. I also do get more tense and stressed when I'm working on the procrastinated task within a limited time frame. But, passively procrastinating can also serve as a coping mechanism in some, as taking a break for yourself is a good way to relieve yourself if you're constantly working.</p>
                
                <h3>Relation to Productivity</h3>
                <p>When you passively procrastinate, you're essentially wasting time with mindless activites. Any task that someone could be doing when passively procrastinating is not productive at all, since most of the tasks done don't require much thinking to perform, and doesn't produce any outcome. Note that simply being lazy isn't really passive procrastination, as to procrastinate, you need to put things aside with intent. If you end up not doing anything and you didn't realize you weren't productive, then you're just being lazy. If you intentionally put off important tasks to do leisurely activities, then you're passively procrastinating.</p>

                    <li>Playing video games instead of exercising.</li>
                    <li>Browsing social media instead of searching for apartments.</li>
                    <li>Binge-watching TV shows instead of interacting with friends.</li>
