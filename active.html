                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Active procrastination is the phenomenon of putting important tasks aside in favor of completing another task. Often, the task being done during procrastination is deemed more important and valuable than the task being procrastinated on.</p>
                
                <h3>Effects on Mental Health</h3>
                <p>When it comes time for me to actually do the task I procrastinated on, I often don't feel tired and more confident to tackle the task. My data suggests that days where I was actively procrastinating, I found myself in a better mood than before, and made me feel proud that I've been productive that day, even though I wasn't doing what I was doing. On another note, it seems that those who also actively procrastinate do it as a coping mechanism, to relieve the stress they'll inevitably have to deal with the procrastinated task, as well as getting a kick from working on something within a limited time frame.</p>
                
                <h3>Relation to Productivity</h3>
                <p>As the name would suggest, active procrastination allows the procrastinator to be actively productive with whatever they're doing. While they are not being productive with the task they need to do, at least they are staying productive with the task they're doing while procrastinating. In fact, comparing active procrastinators to non-procrastinators, they both have similar attributes such as how they use their time, and coping mechanisms.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cleaning around the house instead of paying bills</li>
                    <li>Spending time with your family instead of job searching.</li>
                    <li>Developing your resume instead of writing your school essay.</li>
                    <li>Working on a personal project instead of your final project.</li>
                </ul>
